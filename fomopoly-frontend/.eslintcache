I've played many board games looking for an experience like this, but my search has been unsuccessful. I decided to create it myself. The title is a play on words. See, when a player owns all of one set of spaces of the same color, it's kind of like they have a \"monopoly\" over the whole area. But monopolies aren't fun. They're bad and illegal. So I decided to make the monopolies fun-monopolies, hence the name: Fomopoly. I didn't really know what the rents should be, so I sort of just put in random numbers? There's kind of a pattern to it, a little, but it was mostly just random. As a result, the game might have some balancing issues. If you notice any, feel free to report those issues via the link on the bottom of this page.</p>\n        <a href='https://github.com/Directrix777/fomopoly'>Report An Issue</a>\n    </div>)\n}","/Users/programmingschool/Development/Projects/fomopoly/fomopoly-frontend/src/actions/userActions.js",[],"/Users/programmingschool/Development/Projects/fomopoly/fomopoly-frontend/src/components/AboutPageContainer.js",[],"/Users/programmingschool/Development/Projects/fomopoly/fomopoly-frontend/src/components/TradeHandler.js",["97"],"/Users/programmingschool/Development/Projects/fomopoly/fomopoly-frontend/src/components/TraderCard.js",[],"/Users/programmingschool/Development/Projects/fomopoly/fomopoly-frontend/src/components/UserStatCard.js",[],"/Users/programmingschool/Development/Projects/fomopoly/fomopoly-frontend/src/App.js",[],"/Users/programmingschool/Development/Projects/fomopoly/fomopoly-frontend/src/components/CornerSpace.js",["98"],"/Users/programmingschool/Development/Projects/fomopoly/fomopoly-frontend/src/components/OperatorCard.js",["99"],{"ruleId":"100","replacedBy":"101"},{"ruleId":"102","replacedBy":"103"},{"ruleId":"100","replacedBy":"104"},{"ruleId":"102","replacedBy":"105"},{"ruleId":"106","severity":1,"message":"107","line":141,"column":13,"nodeType":"108","messageId":"109","endLine":147,"endColumn":21},{"ruleId":"100","replacedBy":"110"},{"ruleId":"102","replacedBy":"111"},{"ruleId":"100","replacedBy":"112"},{"ruleId":"102","replacedBy":"113"},{"ruleId":"114","severity":1,"message":"115","line":2,"column":19,"nodeType":"116","messageId":"117","endLine":2,"endColumn":23},{"ruleId":"118","severity":1,"message":"119","line":76,"column":128,"nodeType":"120","messageId":"121","endLine":76,"endColumn":132,"fix":"122"},{"ruleId":"123","severity":1,"message":"124","line":9,"column":5,"nodeType":"125","messageId":"126","endLine":40,"endColumn":6},{"ruleId":"114","severity":1,"message":"127","line":3,"column":8,"nodeType":"116","messageId":"117","endLine":3,"endColumn":14},"no-native-reassign",["128"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["129"],["128"],["129"],"no-lone-blocks","Nested block is redundant.","BlockStatement","redundantNestedBlock",["128"],["129"],["128"],["129"],"no-unused-vars","'Link' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar","no-extra-bind","The function binding is unnecessary.","CallExpression","unexpected",{"range":"130","text":"131"},"default-case","Expected a default case.","SwitchStatement","missingDefaultCase","'Button' is defined but never used.","no-global-assign","no-unsafe-negation",[2490,2501],""]
