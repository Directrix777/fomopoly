I've played many board games looking for an experience like this, but my search has been unsuccessful. I decided to create it myself. The title is a play on words. See, when a player owns all of one set of spaces of the same color, it's kind of like they have a \"monopoly\" over the whole area. But monopolies aren't fun. They're bad and illegal. So I decided to make the monopolies fun-monopolies, hence the name: Fomopoly. I didn't really know what the rents should be, so I sort of just put in random numbers? There's kind of a pattern to it, a little, but it was mostly just random. As a result, the game might have some balancing issues. If you notice any, feel free to report those issues via the link on the bottom of this page.</p>\n        <a href='https://github.com/Directrix777/fomopoly'>Report An Issue</a>\n    </div>)\n}","/Users/programmingschool/Development/Projects/fomopoly/fomopoly-frontend/src/actions/userActions.js",[],"/Users/programmingschool/Development/Projects/fomopoly/fomopoly-frontend/src/components/AboutPageContainer.js",[],"/Users/programmingschool/Development/Projects/fomopoly/fomopoly-frontend/src/components/TradeHandler.js",["93"],"/Users/programmingschool/Development/Projects/fomopoly/fomopoly-frontend/src/components/TraderCard.js",[],"/Users/programmingschool/Development/Projects/fomopoly/fomopoly-frontend/src/components/UserStatCard.js",[],"/Users/programmingschool/Development/Projects/fomopoly/fomopoly-frontend/src/App.js",[],"/Users/programmingschool/Development/Projects/fomopoly/fomopoly-frontend/src/components/CornerSpace.js",["94"],{"ruleId":"95","replacedBy":"96"},{"ruleId":"97","replacedBy":"98"},{"ruleId":"95","replacedBy":"99"},{"ruleId":"97","replacedBy":"100"},{"ruleId":"101","severity":1,"message":"102","line":141,"column":13,"nodeType":"103","messageId":"104","endLine":147,"endColumn":21},{"ruleId":"95","replacedBy":"105"},{"ruleId":"97","replacedBy":"106"},{"ruleId":"95","replacedBy":"107"},{"ruleId":"97","replacedBy":"108"},{"ruleId":"109","severity":1,"message":"110","line":2,"column":19,"nodeType":"111","messageId":"112","endLine":2,"endColumn":23},{"ruleId":"113","severity":1,"message":"114","line":74,"column":128,"nodeType":"115","messageId":"116","endLine":74,"endColumn":132,"fix":"117"},{"ruleId":"118","severity":1,"message":"119","line":9,"column":5,"nodeType":"120","messageId":"121","endLine":40,"endColumn":6},"no-native-reassign",["122"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["123"],["122"],["123"],"no-lone-blocks","Nested block is redundant.","BlockStatement","redundantNestedBlock",["122"],["123"],["122"],["123"],"no-unused-vars","'Link' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar","no-extra-bind","The function binding is unnecessary.","CallExpression","unexpected",{"range":"124","text":"125"},"default-case","Expected a default case.","SwitchStatement","missingDefaultCase","no-global-assign","no-unsafe-negation",[2331,2342],""]
